For this assigment I used logic to generate a random password based on user inputs.
I started the assignment by creating variables that would represent the different options for a password, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
Once I created my variables, I made a function to generate the password.
I started the function with prompts giving the user the option to customize their password. 
The var lookUplist would store the true statements that followed the variable. Based on the answers the  would store the options. The last lines generated the password.
